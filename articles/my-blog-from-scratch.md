  Hi, I’m Juan Burciaga. I work with software and also make small games on
  the side. Most of my time goes into building and fixing large systems,
  but I like sharing some of what I learn here. Sometimes it’s about
  coding, sometimes about games, or just things I’m trying out.

I decided to create a simple blog from scratch to start contributing
to the community with whatever knowledge I may have. Why make it
simple and code it myself? Two reasons: 1. Because KISS. 2. I miss
the simplicity of an HTML file.

In my day to day, I have to deal with complicated build processes
and pipelines, from compiling a TypeScript app into a JS bundle to
handling multiple layers of the stack. Changing the content and
publishing it by copying it to the server has a certain appeal that
reminds me of the late 90s and early 2000s.

When I was a teenager, I learned to code HTML sites by navigating
personal websites and searching the links section—the part of the
site that used to have all the links to other websites the person
liked. This was not only fun, but I wondered: how was that even
possible? It looked like magic to me. When I discovered the "View
Page Source" button, it felt as if the wizard was showing me how to
cast the spell.

So in the beginning, this will be a basic page with a list of
articles and other pages for the articles. I don't intend to
reinvent the wheel; I will be using some CSS frameworks to play
around, like [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) in the first
version.

I am aware of the upcoming complexity that maintaining a blog by
hand brings, and probably my next step will be building a rendering
engine from an MD file or something similar. But that is the whole
point of this: start simple, improve in small increments, and
eventually make the jump to a backend script to handle other
features to make my life easier.
