          <!-- Converted Markdown goes here -->
          <p>I decided to create a simple blog from scratch to start
          contributing to the community with whatever knowledge I may
          have. Why make it simple and code it myself? Two reasons: 1.
          Because KISS. 2. I miss the simplicity of an HTML file.</p>
          <p>In my day to day, I have to deal with complicated build
          processes and pipelines, from compiling a TypeScript app into
          a JS bundle to handling multiple layers of the stack. Changing
          the content and publishing it by copying it to the server has
          a certain appeal that reminds me of the late 90s and early
          2000s.</p>
          <p>When I was a teenager, I learned to code HTML sites by
          navigating personal websites and searching the links
          section—the part of the site that used to have all the links
          to other websites the person liked. This was not only fun, but
          I wondered: how was that even possible? It looked like magic
          to me. When I discovered the “View Page Source” button, it
          felt as if the wizard was showing me how to cast the
          spell.</p>
          <p>So in the beginning, this will be a basic page with a list
          of articles and other pages for the articles. I don’t intend
          to reinvent the wheel; I will be using some CSS frameworks to
          play around, like <a href="https://picocss.com/">PicoCSS</a>
          in the first version.</p>
          <p>I am aware of the upcoming complexity that maintaining a
          blog by hand brings, and probably my next step will be
          building a rendering engine from an MD file or something
          similar. But that is the whole point of this: start simple,
          improve in small increments, and eventually make the jump to a
          backend script to handle other features to make my life
          easier.</p>

      <h4>ABOUT Juan Burciaga</h4>
      <p>
        <p>Hi, I’m Juan Burciaga. I work with software and also make
small games on the side. Most of my time goes into building and fixing
large systems, but I like sharing some of what I learn here. Sometimes
it’s about coding, sometimes about games, or just things I’m trying
out.</p>
